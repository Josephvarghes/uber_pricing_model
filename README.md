# Uber Pricing Model

# Problem Statement
Uber faces challenges in handling and analyzing large volumes of data, leading to inefficiencies in predicting pricing and identifying areas for improvement. This project involves cleaning and analyzing Uber's data to derive insights and offer actionable recommendations for pricing optimization. The cleaned and relevant dataset will help identify areas where Uber can improve its service to enhance efficiency and customer satisfaction.

# Approach
* Data Cleaning
- Data Preprocessing: The dataset, which was large and messy, was cleaned using Python libraries like Pandas and Numpy. I removed irrelevant columns and handled missing values to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the dataset.
- Feature Selection: After cleaning, I selected only the relevant features that directly influence the Uber pricing model, ensuring the analysis is focused on actionable insights.
Analysis
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed a comprehensive analysis of the dataset using libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize key patterns and relationships in the data.
Area for Improvement: Based on the analysis, I identified areas Uber needs to focus on for improvement, such as pricing disparities in certain regions, ride times, and other key factors that influence fare estimations.
# Technologies Used
- Python: Primary programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.
- Numpy: Used for efficient numerical operations and data handling.
- Pandas: Essential for cleaning, organizing, and manipulating large datasets.
- Seaborn: Used for visualizing and understanding patterns in the data.
- Kaggle Dataset: The dataset was collected from Kaggle to ensure accuracy and reliability.
# Recommendations for Improvement
Pricing Optimization: Suggest areas where pricing models can be adjusted to maximize profitability without compromising customer satisfaction.
Operational Improvements: Identify regions where Uber's service could be optimized in terms of ride-time prediction and pricing consistency.
Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle and includes detailed information on Uber rides, such as location, distance, time, and fare prices. This data is vital for building a predictive model for Uber's pricing strategy.
